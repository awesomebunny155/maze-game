# Feature Priority Checklist #
- [ ] Basic objects such as maze bars and character must be created as sprites in the game
- [ ] Collision detection feature must be incorporated to prevent the character from going beyond the maze bars
- [ ] Use GUI buttons for replayability of game
- [ ] Use color themes and decide the overall subject of the game
- [ ] Resize the character and make it match with the background through the use of MS Paint
- [ ] Make the character small-scale so that it can fit through every corner of the maze bars
- [ ] Add randomness in the replay (random library)
- [ ] Add intro and exit cards to keep it consistent 
- [ ] Import music or background noises to keep the pygame fun
- [ ] If time permits, add a counter feature and breakout room feature through time (Might have to use unexplored libraries)
##### Since there was only one week to work on the project, this feature can be implemented in future assignments or possibly the final project for ICS3U1 course #####
